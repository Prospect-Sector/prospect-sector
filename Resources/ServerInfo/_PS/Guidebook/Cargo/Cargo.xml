  # Cargo

  The Supply department — commonly referred to as [color=cyan]Cargo[/color] — is responsible for keeping the station supplied with **raw materials**, **processed goods**, and **printed components**.
  Cargo works closely with Salvage to ensure the station always has the resources needed for construction, repairs, research, and everyday crew needs.

  Unlike traditional stations, this facility does **not** use currency, bounties, or sales systems.
  Cargo’s value comes from **resource management**, **logistics**, and **material processing**.

  -------------------------------------------------------------

  ## Personnel

  Cargo consists of:
  - [color=cyan]Cargo Technicians[/color] — logistics, storage, printing, processing
  - [color=cyan]Salvage Specialists[/color] — wreck recovery, material acquisition
  - Led by the [color=cyan]Quartermaster[/color] — department management &amp; supply oversight

  ## What Cargo Does

  Cargo has three core responsibilities:

  ### [color=cyan]1. Acquire Raw Materials[/color]
  Cargo gathers resources primarily by:
  - Using the **salvage magnet** to pull in wrecks
  - Recovering debris, scrap, and ore during salvage expeditions

  ### [color=cyan]2. Process Materials[/color]
  Once raw materials are collected, Cargo converts them into usable forms using:
  - The **material processor**
  - The **lathe** (for sheets, rods, parts, and components)

  Cargo ensures the entire station has access to:
  - Metal &amp; glass sheets
  - Plasteel
  - Electronics
  - Machine parts
  - Tools &amp; structural materials

  ### [color=cyan]3. Print &amp; Deliver Components[/color]
  Cargo prints parts and components requested by station departments.
  Cargo Technicians must:
  - Keep lathes stocked
  - Process ore quickly
  - Deliver printed items and materials
  - Maintain a healthy reserve of raw resources

  The Quartermaster may prioritize essential requests during low supply periods.

  -------------------------------------------------------------

  ## Storage System

  Cargo has access to a unique **high-capacity storage system**.
  This system allows the department to store:
  - Processed materials
  - Most raw ores
  - Common building supplies
  - Bulk components

  Not everything can be stored, but **raw materials and basic components almost always can**.

  The storage system enables Cargo to:
  - Stockpile large reserves
  - Retrieve stored goods during construction spikes
  - Ensure consistent material availability
  - Efficiently support engineering, science, and medical fabrication requests

  ## How to Operate Cargo Effectively

  ### Keep the Magnet Busy
  Regularly pull wrecks to keep supplies flowing. Communicate with Salvage on when to launch recovery.

  ### Process Immediately
  Ore sitting in a pile helps nobody. Convert it quickly into usable sheets or components.

  ### Maintain Stock Levels
  Ensure the station never runs out of:
  - Metal
  - Glass
  - Plastic
  - Electronics
  - Machine parts

  ### Respond to Crew Needs
  When someone needs something printed or supplied, Cargo should:
  - Check the storage system
  - Print required components
  - Deliver the items or make them available for pickup

  -------------------------------------------------------------

  ## Cargo’s Purpose

  Cargo’s mission is not profit — it is **support**.

  Cargo ensures:
  - The station has the materials needed to function
  - Departments can construct, repair, and fabricate
  - Salvage can operate efficiently
  - Engineering always has structural materials
  - Science and Medical have access to printed components
  - Crew have the tools and parts needed for their tasks

  A strong Cargo team enables the whole station to thrive.
