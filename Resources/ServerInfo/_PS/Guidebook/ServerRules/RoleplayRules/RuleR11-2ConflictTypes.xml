  # Roleplay Rule 11-2 – Examples of Conflict Types

  - Arguing or insulting (within RP boundaries)

  - Shoving
  - Light pranks
  - Stealing **non-critical, easily replaced items** (cups, pens, small tools)

  - Stealing items that inconvenience but do not endanger someone
  - Taking an ID in a location where the person is **not trapped or endangered**
  - Punching or simple fistfights
  - Using disablers or stuns in controlled RP situations
  - Detaining someone non-lethally during a dispute

  ## Lethal
  - Beating someone into crit or death (requires strong justification)
  - Attacking with dangerous tools or weapons (bats, spears, etc.)
  - Stealing items that place someone at **risk**, such as a hardsuit needed for safety
