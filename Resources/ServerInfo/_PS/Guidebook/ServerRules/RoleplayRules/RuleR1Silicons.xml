  # Roleplay Rule 1 – Silicons Must Follow Silicon Rules

  You are only a silicon if the game clearly and explicitly assigns you a silicon or AI-equivalent role.

  If you are a silicon, the **Silicon Rules override all other Roleplay Rules** in cases of conflict.
  However, Silicon Rules **never override Core Rules** such as harassment, griefing, or discriminatory behavior.

  Silicons in Prospect Sector exist to support station operations and progression, not to act as antagonists or disruptive forces.
