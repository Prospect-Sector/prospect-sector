  # Roleplay Rule 2 – Familiars Must Obey Their Master

  A familiar is a special **bound role** assigned explicitly by the game.
  You are only a familiar if the game clearly designates you as one, and you are bound **only** to the master the game assigns.

  Familiars are considered **non-antagonists**, but they must:
  - Obey their master’s direct orders
  - Prioritize those orders over normal Roleplay Rules
  - Continue following previously given orders even if the master dies (when reasonable)
  - Defend their master unless ordered not to

  However:
  - Orders **never override Core Rules** (harassment, grief, hate speech, etc.).
  - A familiar may ahelp if their master gives an order that violates rules.
  - The **master** is responsible for any Roleplay Rule violations caused by improper or abusive orders.

  Familiars exist to support unique roleplay and mechanics, not to enable rule-breaking.
