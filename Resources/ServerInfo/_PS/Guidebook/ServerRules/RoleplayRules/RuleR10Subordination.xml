  # Roleplay Rule 10 – Respect Command and Department Leadership

  Prospect Sector is a cooperative environment.
  Command roles (such as Station Lead/HoP/QM) and department heads exist to **coordinate**, not to control every action.
  You are not required to follow every order perfectly, but you are expected to:

  - Allow leaders to lead
  - Not undermine or sabotage leadership
  - Follow reasonable instructions related to your department or station progression
  - Use roleplay to resolve disagreements

  You may ignore orders that are:
  - Unsafe
  - Impossible for you to perform
  - Outside your department or expertise
  - Obvious grief, sabotage, or against Core/Roleplay rules

  Leadership is collaborative—not authoritarian.

  ## Examples

  ### Acceptable:
  - An engineer explains they don’t know how to do a task and asks to be taught.
  - An atmos tech refuses an unsafe order that would cause an atmos disaster.
  - Command is temporarily ignored because engineering is responding to an emergency.
  - A botanist decides to grow different plants than requested but still contributes to food supply.
  - A worker expresses disagreement with a plan but still helps execute it.
  - Crew replaces a negligent or disruptive leader through in-character means.

  ### Prohibited:
  - Intentionally ignoring leadership solely to disrupt station workflow.
  - Refusing all orders without explanation or RP justification.
  - Sabotaging or blocking a department because you disagree with the leader.
  - Disobeying instructions that fall within your job and are safe, reasonable, and necessary.
  - Undermining command authority through hostility, stonewalling, or coordinated disruption.

  ## Final Note
  Leaders are expected to act reasonably and cooperatively.
  Crew are expected to respect leadership enough to keep the game flowing.
  Neither side may use their position to grief or obstruct progression.
