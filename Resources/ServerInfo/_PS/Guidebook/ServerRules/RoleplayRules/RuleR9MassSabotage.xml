  # Roleplay Rule 9 – Do Not Cause Excessive Death, Damage, or Destruction

  Prospect Sector has **no antagonist roles**.
  Therefore, no player ever has permission or justification to cause major destruction, mass death, or wide-scale sabotage.

  Players must not:
  - Destroy large sections of the station
  - Disable core infrastructure
  - Cause atmos disasters, fires, explosions, or mass power failures
  - Round-remove or kill players without valid escalation
  - Harm the station in ways that halt progression or make areas uninhabitable

  Even with roleplay justification, large-scale sabotage is never acceptable.
  Minor accidents, mistakes, or localized issues are normal and expected; **intentional** destruction is not.

  ## Examples

  ### Acceptable:
  - Small, localized damage caused accidentally while working (engineering mistakes, testing errors).
  - Causing minor, recoverable issues during legitimate gameplay (an experiment goes wrong).
  - Defending yourself with proportionate force when escalated to violence.

  ### Prohibited:
  - Detonating bombs or explosives in populated areas.
  - Releasing dangerous anomalies, mobs, singularities, or hazardous atmos.
  - Destroying power generation, SMES, atmos systems, or critical machinery.
  - Intentionally spacing areas, depressurizing departments, or creating large fires.
  - Causing mass death or disabling multiple departments at once.
  - Using destructive tools to grief the station or halt progression.
  - Round-removing players without escalation or extreme justification.

  ## Final Note
  Prospect Sector is a **cooperative environment**.
  Intentional large-scale destruction is always considered griefing unless directly authorized by administrators for a special event.
