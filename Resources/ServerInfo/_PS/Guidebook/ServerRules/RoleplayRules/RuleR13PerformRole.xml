  # Roleplay Rule 13 – Stick to Your Role

  Each job in Prospect Sector exists to support **station progression** or **expedition gameplay**.
  While helping others is encouraged, you should not **take over another department’s responsibilities** unless there is a clear need.

  Requesting a job change is allowed.
  This rule is relaxed if the station is **understaffed**, during **emergencies**, or when defending yourself.

  Do not:
  - Perform another department’s core duties without reason
  - Insert yourself into specialized roles you are not trained for
  - Act as “security” in a game mode that has no formal security
  - Take over critical jobs simply because you want to

  This rule is enforced **more strictly on MRP**.

  ## Examples

  ### Acceptable:
  - As an engineer, helping the bartender remodel or reinforce the bar.
  - As a bartender, renovating your workspace.
  - As a passenger, building harmless projects with provided materials.
  - As an engineer, reinforcing substations or improving airlock security.
  - As an atmos tech, improving atmospheric pipelines and systems.
  - As a passenger, defending yourself from someone who is attacking you.
  - As crew on an understaffed station, performing engineering tasks because no engineers exist.

  ### Prohibited:
  - As a passenger, reinforcing electrical infrastructure without engineering involvement.
  - As a passenger, acting as station law enforcement or “security.”
  - As a passenger, fighting on behalf of someone else in a situation unrelated to you.
