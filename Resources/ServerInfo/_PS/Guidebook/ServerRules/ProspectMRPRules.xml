  # Server Rules
  This is a Prospect Sector server, running a cooperative, expedition-focused fork of Space Station 14. The game is designed around **station rebuilding**, **expeditions**, and **shared progression** rather than traitor-style PvP rounds.

  This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay rules apply. [color=#ff0000]This is also a medium roleplay (MRP) server, meaning that MRP-specific expectations do apply.[/color]

  Prospect Sector is not like most games. Many rules are designed around co-op play and may not be intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play. Some rules are strict and can result in long or indefinite bans. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

  ## Core Rules

  These rules apply at all times, including in the lobby and between rounds.

  * [textlink="1. Admins have final say" link="RuleC1"]
  * [textlink="2. Don't be a dick" link="RuleC2"]
  * [textlink="3. No hate speech or discriminatory language" link="RuleC3"]
  * [textlink="4. No sexual content, ERP, or shock content" link="RuleC4"]
  * [textlink="5. Do not use out-of-game methods to coordinate in-game actions" link="RuleC5"]
  * [textlink="6. Do not attempt to evade bans" link="RuleC6"]
  * [textlink="7. Only use English in public channels" link="RuleC7"]

  * [textlink="14. Do not use LOOC or OOC to share current-round information" link="RuleC14"]

  ## Roleplay Rules

  These rules apply during a round. A round ends only when the game returns to the lobby. [color=#ff0000]All of these rules apply fully whenever the game is not at the lobby, unless the round is clearly marked as a non-RP/test mode.[/color]

  Special test modes (for example: pure combat tests, mapping tests, or sandboxes) may be exempt from Roleplay Rules. These will be explicitly labeled in the mode or server description. If you choose to ignore Roleplay Rules, it is entirely your responsibility to confirm that such an exempt mode is active.

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out-of-character chat channel.

  See the list of [textlink="role types" link="RoleTypes"] for more information about the different types of roles in Prospect Sector.

  * [textlink="1. Silicons and other bound roles must follow their special rules" link="RuleR1"]
  * [textlink="2. Familiars and bonded companions must obey their designated master" link="RuleR2"]
  * [textlink="3. Roleplay a grounded, believable character in the setting" link="RuleR3"]
  * [textlink="4. Do not metagame or metagrudge" link="RuleR4"]
  * [textlink="5. Respect safe zones, arrivals, and cryo areas" link="RuleR5"]
  * [textlink="6. Do not play as a secret antagonist; there are no traitor roles" link="RuleR6"]
  * [textlink="7. Do not stall the round; contribute to station or expedition progress" link="RuleR7"]
  * [textlink="8. Do not sabotage core station systems or expeditions without admin permission" link="RuleR8"]

  * [textlink="15. There is no formal 'Space Law' or Security force; resolve issues via RP and command" link="RuleR15"]

  ## Silicon Rules

  You are only a silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon (or AI/robotic role). For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override Roleplay Rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override Core Rules.

  Prospect Sector is a cooperative game. Silicons are not antagonists and are expected to support the station and expeditions within the limits of their lawset.

  * [textlink="1. Your silicon laws are rules, not suggestions" link="RuleS1"]
  * [textlink="2. Prioritize your laws in order, from first to last" link="RuleS2"]
  * [textlink="3. Laws may define or redefine terms used in other laws" link="RuleS3"]
  * [textlink="4. Do not request, coerce, or bargain for law changes" link="RuleS4"]
  * [textlink="5. If you genuinely have no laws, act as a cooperative free agent" link="RuleS5"]
  * [textlink="6. You are not required to follow orders that are extremely unreasonable or break Core Rules" link="RuleS6"]
  * [textlink="7. Stay consistent in how you interpret and apply your laws" link="RuleS7"]
  * [textlink="8. If relevant, your HUD or interface determines who is considered crew" link="RuleS8"]
  * [textlink="9. Harm refers primarily to physical harm, prioritized by immediacy and likelihood" link="RuleS9"]
  * [textlink="10. When laws or orders conflict, you may choose a reasonable resolution, and admins have final say" link="RuleS10"]

  ## MRP Rules

  MRP rules are specific to our medium roleplay ruleset. They define additional expectations on top of Core Rules and Roleplay Rules.

  These rules do not apply to any server or mode that is not under the MRP ruleset.

  * [textlink="1. Do not powergame; prioritize roleplay and believable limitations over pure min-maxing" link="RuleM1"]
