  # Welcome to Space Station 14!

  Your shift has begun aboard an isolated installation in the Prospect Sector.
  Here, scattered outposts survive on teamwork, routine, and the grit of the crews who keep them running.
  Every round, you and your fellow crewmates write the story of your station through your choices, teamwork, and problem-solving.

  ## Life in the Prospect Sector
  Space Station 14, in the context of the Prospect Sector, is one of many remote installations operating far from stable supply lines.
  Stations rely heavily on their crew to maintain systems, gather resources, and adapt to hazards that appear without warning.

  Each shift brings:
  - New challenges as systems degrade or events unfold
  - Changing crew needs based on the tasks and threats of the moment
  - Opportunities to collaborate, specialize, and support your department
  - A highly simulated environment where small decisions ripple outward

  The game is an [italic]open-source project[/italic] maintained by volunteers and receives
  [color=lime]frequent updates[/color]. Such rapid development means the game may occasionally be
  [color=#EB2D3A][bold]unstable.[/bold][/color]
